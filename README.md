# Code Challenges Using Github

This tool allows you to create a coding challenge based on a template repository. When it creates the coding challenge it also invites a candidate (with their Github name) to the repository and also adds this to a tracking repository as issues. The tracking repository can be configured with a project (using the regular Github UX) to track the status of coding challenge.

## Introduction

In order to use the tool, first you need to configure it. Once the configuration is done the usage is as easy as follows:

```
challenge create -u CANDIDATEGITHUBUSERNAME -d DISCIPLINEASCONFIGURED

```
